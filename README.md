# CA1-Web-Application-Development
This repository is of our group project for Part A of CA1 for Web Application Development.

We developed a website for a Video Store. We each worked on different aspects of the website, i.e. Sean worked on the JavaScript, Shane worked on the HTML, Lee worked on the CSS,
and Cree worked on the XML.
